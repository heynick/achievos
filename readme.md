Achievos
==

A Chrome browser extension that rewards achievements for discovering websites.

While developing locally run
`npm run serve`
which starts the Gulp watch task as well as the Express server.

Livereload runs on `localhost:3000`.
Example of successful result:
`http://localhost:3000/request?url=zombo.com`

Deliberately not including the `urls.js` file as this is where the shheeecrets are.
